## For this project, the instructions were to create a simple speed-typing test application where users can compete with themselves, and others, to see how fast they can type indivudial words.

## The following user stories were given,

1. User can click a 'Start Practice' button to start the practice session.
2. When a practice session starts, the timer starts increasing
3. User is shown a word
4. User can type the word in a text input box
5. If a user enters an incorrect letter, the text input box is cleared
6. If a user enters all letters correctly, then the text input box is cleared and a new word is shown
7. User can click "End Practice" button to end the session.
8. When the session ends, the typing speed is shown (words per minute)

## Project was made solely with Javascript and React, using CRA.
